\f0\fs24 \cf0 The provided website in this assignment helped a tremendous amount. Using the website, I was able to establish the currentTime and currentDate variables and display todays date at the top of my page. I then added the for loop to create row divs for each hour in the typical work day (9-5). There is a text area in each div where you can enter events and a save button which will be used to save text to the local storage. I then used if and else if statements to assign colors to our past, current and future hour divs. Lastly, I attempted to make the save buttons store data in the local storage. Unfortunately, I will need this weekend to continue messing with this and looking for a solution.}
